        "info": "In French, prepositions are words that typically come before a noun, pronoun, or infinitive verb and establish a relationship between that word and other elements in the sentence. Here's an overview of the basic grammar of prepositions in French:\n\n1. **Position**: Prepositions are placed before the noun, pronoun, or infinitive verb they modify. For example:\n   - \"sur la table\" (on the table)\n   - \"avec mon ami\" (with my friend)\n   - \"pour manger\" (to eat)\n\n2. **Agreement**: In French, some prepositions require agreement with the noun they modify in gender and number. However, most prepositions do not change form based on the gender or number of the noun. For example:\n   - \"sur la table\" (on the table) - feminine singular\n   - \"sur les tables\" (on the tables) - feminine plural\n   - \"avec mon ami\" (with my friend) - masculine singular\n   - \"avec mes amis\" (with my friends) - masculine plural\n\n3. **Usage**: Prepositions in French are used to indicate various relationships, including location, time, manner, cause, and more. Some common prepositions in French include \"sur\" (on, upon), \"dans\" (in, inside), \"à\" (at, to), \"de\" (of, from), \"avec\" (with), and \"pour\" (for), among others.\n\n4. **Contractions**: In French, prepositions often contract with definite articles to form contractions. For example:\n   - \"au\" = \"à\" + \"le\" (to the)\n   - \"aux\" = \"à\" + \"les\" (to the)\n\n5. **Prepositional Phrases**: Prepositions in French often form prepositional phrases when combined with nouns, pronouns, or other elements. These phrases provide additional information about location, time, direction, etc. For example:\n   - \"à la maison\" (at home)\n   - \"dans la matinée\" (in the morning)\n   - \"avec ma sœur\" (with my sister)\n\nUnderstanding the basic grammar of prepositions is essential for constructing grammatically correct sentences and expressing ideas accurately in French.",

        "info": "In French, prepositions are words that typically come before a noun, pronoun, or infinitive verb and establish a relationship between that word and other elements in the sentence. Here's an overview of the basic grammar of prepositions in French:\n\n1. **Position**: Prepositions are placed before the noun, pronoun, or infinitive verb they modify. For example:\n   - \"sur la table\" (on the table)\n   - \"avec mon ami\" (with my friend)\n   - \"pour manger\" (to eat)\n\n2. **Agreement**: In French, some prepositions require agreement with the noun they modify in gender and number. However, most prepositions do not change form based on the gender or number of the noun. For example:\n   - \"sur la table\" (on the table) - feminine singular\n   - \"sur les tables\" (on the tables) - feminine plural\n   - \"avec mon ami\" (with my friend) - masculine singular\n   - \"avec mes amis\" (with my friends) - masculine plural\n\n3. **Usage**: Prepositions in French are used to indicate various relationships, including location, time, manner, cause, and more. Some common prepositions in French include \"sur\" (on, upon), \"dans\" (in, inside), \"à\" (at, to), \"de\" (of, from), \"avec\" (with), and \"pour\" (for), among others.\n\n4. **Contractions**: In French, prepositions often contract with definite articles to form contractions. For example:\n   - \"au\" = \"à\" + \"le\" (to the)\n   - \"aux\" = \"à\" + \"les\" (to the)\n\n5. **Prepositional Phrases**: Prepositions in French often form prepositional phrases when combined with nouns, pronouns, or other elements. These phrases provide additional information about location, time, direction, etc. For example:\n   - \"à la maison\" (at home)\n   - \"dans la matinée\" (in the morning)\n   - \"avec ma sœur\" (with my sister)\n\nUnderstanding the basic grammar of prepositions is essential for constructing grammatically correct sentences and expressing ideas accurately in French.",

        "info": "In French, prepositions are words that typically come before a noun, pronoun, or infinitive verb and establish a relationship between that word and other elements in the sentence. Here's an overview of the basic grammar of prepositions in French:\n\n1. **Position**: Prepositions are placed before the noun, pronoun, or infinitive verb they modify. For example:\n   - \"sur la table\" (on the table)\n   - \"avec mon ami\" (with my friend)\n   - \"pour manger\" (to eat)\n\n2. **Agreement**: In French, some prepositions require agreement with the noun they modify in gender and number. However, most prepositions do not change form based on the gender or number of the noun. For example:\n   - \"sur la table\" (on the table) - feminine singular\n   - \"sur les tables\" (on the tables) - feminine plural\n   - \"avec mon ami\" (with my friend) - masculine singular\n   - \"avec mes amis\" (with my friends) - masculine plural\n\n3. **Usage**: Prepositions in French are used to indicate various relationships, including location, time, manner, cause, and more. Some common prepositions in French include \"sur\" (on, upon), \"dans\" (in, inside), \"à\" (at, to), \"de\" (of, from), \"avec\" (with), and \"pour\" (for), among others.\n\n4. **Contractions**: In French, prepositions often contract with definite articles to form contractions. For example:\n   - \"au\" = \"à\" + \"le\" (to the)\n   - \"aux\" = \"à\" + \"les\" (to the)\n\n5. **Prepositional Phrases**: Prepositions in French often form prepositional phrases when combined with nouns, pronouns, or other elements. These phrases provide additional information about location, time, direction, etc. For example:\n   - \"à la maison\" (at home)\n   - \"dans la matinée\" (in the morning)\n   - \"avec ma sœur\" (with my sister)\n\nUnderstanding the basic grammar of prepositions is essential for constructing grammatically correct sentences and expressing ideas accurately in French.",

        "info": "In French, prepositions are words that typically come before a noun, pronoun, or infinitive verb and establish a relationship between that word and other elements in the sentence. Here's an overview of the basic grammar of prepositions in French:\n\n1. **Position**: Prepositions are placed before the noun, pronoun, or infinitive verb they modify. For example:\n   - \"sur la table\" (on the table)\n   - \"avec mon ami\" (with my friend)\n   - \"pour manger\" (to eat)\n\n2. **Agreement**: In French, some prepositions require agreement with the noun they modify in gender and number. However, most prepositions do not change form based on the gender or number of the noun. For example:\n   - \"sur la table\" (on the table) - feminine singular\n   - \"sur les tables\" (on the tables) - feminine plural\n   - \"avec mon ami\" (with my friend) - masculine singular\n   - \"avec mes amis\" (with my friends) - masculine plural\n\n3. **Usage**: Prepositions in French are used to indicate various relationships, including location, time, manner, cause, and more. Some common prepositions in French include \"sur\" (on, upon), \"dans\" (in, inside), \"à\" (at, to), \"de\" (of, from), \"avec\" (with), and \"pour\" (for), among others.\n\n4. **Contractions**: In French, prepositions often contract with definite articles to form contractions. For example:\n   - \"au\" = \"à\" + \"le\" (to the)\n   - \"aux\" = \"à\" + \"les\" (to the)\n\n5. **Prepositional Phrases**: Prepositions in French often form prepositional phrases when combined with nouns, pronouns, or other elements. These phrases provide additional information about location, time, direction, etc. For example:\n   - \"à la maison\" (at home)\n   - \"dans la matinée\" (in the morning)\n   - \"avec ma sœur\" (with my sister)\n\nUnderstanding the basic grammar of prepositions is essential for constructing grammatically correct sentences and expressing ideas accurately in French.",
