        "info": "In German, prepositions are words that typically come before a noun, pronoun, or verb and establish a relationship between that word and other elements in the sentence. Here's an overview of the basic grammar of prepositions in German:\n\n1. **Position**: Prepositions are placed before the noun, pronoun, or verb they modify. For example:\n   - \"auf dem Tisch\" (on the table)\n   - \"mit meinem Freund\" (with my friend)\n   - \"für das Essen\" (for the meal)\n\n2. **Case**: In German, prepositions are often used with certain cases (nominative, accusative, dative, or genitive), which can change depending on the context and the preposition used. Each preposition may govern one or more cases, and this determines the form of the article or pronoun that follows it. For example:\n   - \"auf dem Tisch\" (on the table) - dative case\n   - \"unter den Tisch\" (under the table) - accusative case\n   - \"mit meinem Freund\" (with my friend) - dative case\n   - \"für das Essen\" (for the meal) - accusative case\n\n3. **Usage**: Prepositions in German are used to indicate various relationships, including location, direction, time, manner, cause, and more. Some common prepositions in German include \"auf\" (on, onto), \"in\" (in, into), \"mit\" (with), \"für\" (for), \"an\" (at, to, on), \"über\" (over, above), and \"unter\" (under), among others.\n\n4. **Prepositional Phrases**: Prepositions in German often form prepositional phrases when combined with nouns, pronouns, or other elements. These phrases provide additional information about location, time, direction, etc. For example:\n   - \"auf dem Tisch\" (on the table)\n   - \"in der Stadt\" (in the city)\n   - \"mit meiner Familie\" (with my family)\n\nUnderstanding the basic grammar of prepositions, including their case requirements, is essential for constructing grammatically correct sentences and expressing ideas accurately in German.",

        "info": "In German, prepositions are words that typically come before a noun, pronoun, or verb and establish a relationship between that word and other elements in the sentence. Here's an overview of the basic grammar of prepositions in German:\n\n1. **Position**: Prepositions are placed before the noun, pronoun, or verb they modify. For example:\n   - \"auf dem Tisch\" (on the table)\n   - \"mit meinem Freund\" (with my friend)\n   - \"für das Essen\" (for the meal)\n\n2. **Case**: In German, prepositions are often used with certain cases (nominative, accusative, dative, or genitive), which can change depending on the context and the preposition used. Each preposition may govern one or more cases, and this determines the form of the article or pronoun that follows it. For example:\n   - \"auf dem Tisch\" (on the table) - dative case\n   - \"unter den Tisch\" (under the table) - accusative case\n   - \"mit meinem Freund\" (with my friend) - dative case\n   - \"für das Essen\" (for the meal) - accusative case\n\n3. **Usage**: Prepositions in German are used to indicate various relationships, including location, direction, time, manner, cause, and more. Some common prepositions in German include \"auf\" (on, onto), \"in\" (in, into), \"mit\" (with), \"für\" (for), \"an\" (at, to, on), \"über\" (over, above), and \"unter\" (under), among others.\n\n4. **Prepositional Phrases**: Prepositions in German often form prepositional phrases when combined with nouns, pronouns, or other elements. These phrases provide additional information about location, time, direction, etc. For example:\n   - \"auf dem Tisch\" (on the table)\n   - \"in der Stadt\" (in the city)\n   - \"mit meiner Familie\" (with my family)\n\nUnderstanding the basic grammar of prepositions, including their case requirements, is essential for constructing grammatically correct sentences and expressing ideas accurately in German.",

        "info": "In German, prepositions are words that typically come before a noun, pronoun, or verb and establish a relationship between that word and other elements in the sentence. Here's an overview of the basic grammar of prepositions in German:\n\n1. **Position**: Prepositions are placed before the noun, pronoun, or verb they modify. For example:\n   - \"auf dem Tisch\" (on the table)\n   - \"mit meinem Freund\" (with my friend)\n   - \"für das Essen\" (for the meal)\n\n2. **Case**: In German, prepositions are often used with certain cases (nominative, accusative, dative, or genitive), which can change depending on the context and the preposition used. Each preposition may govern one or more cases, and this determines the form of the article or pronoun that follows it. For example:\n   - \"auf dem Tisch\" (on the table) - dative case\n   - \"unter den Tisch\" (under the table) - accusative case\n   - \"mit meinem Freund\" (with my friend) - dative case\n   - \"für das Essen\" (for the meal) - accusative case\n\n3. **Usage**: Prepositions in German are used to indicate various relationships, including location, direction, time, manner, cause, and more. Some common prepositions in German include \"auf\" (on, onto), \"in\" (in, into), \"mit\" (with), \"für\" (for), \"an\" (at, to, on), \"über\" (over, above), and \"unter\" (under), among others.\n\n4. **Prepositional Phrases**: Prepositions in German often form prepositional phrases when combined with nouns, pronouns, or other elements. These phrases provide additional information about location, time, direction, etc. For example:\n   - \"auf dem Tisch\" (on the table)\n   - \"in der Stadt\" (in the city)\n   - \"mit meiner Familie\" (with my family)\n\nUnderstanding the basic grammar of prepositions, including their case requirements, is essential for constructing grammatically correct sentences and expressing ideas accurately in German.",

For example:\n   - \"auf dem Tisch\" (on the table)\n   - \"mit meinem Freund\" (with my friend)\n   - \"für das Essen\" (for the meal)\n\n2. **Case**: In German, prepositions are often used with certain cases (nominative, accusative, dative, or genitive), which can change depending on the context and the preposition used. Each preposition may govern one or more cases, and this determines the form of the article or pronoun that follows it. For example:\n   - \"auf dem Tisch\" (on the table) - dative case\n   - \"unter den Tisch\" (under the table) - accusative case\n   - \"mit meinem Freund\" (with my friend) - dative case\n   - \"für das Essen\" (for the meal) - accusative case\n\n3. **Usage**: Prepositions in German are used to indicate various relationships, including location, direction, time, manner, cause, and more. Some common prepositions in German include \"auf\" (on, onto), \"in\" (in, into), \"mit\" (with), \"für\" (for), \"an\" (at, to, on), \"über\" (over, above), and \"unter\" (under), among others.\n\n4. **Prepositional Phrases**: Prepositions in German often form prepositional phrases when combined with nouns, pronouns, or other elements. These phrases provide additional information about location, time, direction, etc. For example:\n   - \"auf dem Tisch\" (on the table)\n   - \"in der Stadt\" (in the city)\n   - \"mit meiner Familie\" (with my family)\n\nUnderstanding the basic grammar of prepositions, including their case requirements, is essential for constructing grammatically correct sentences and expressing ideas accurately in German.",
