        "info": "The gerund is used differently in Spanish compared to English. Here's how:\n\nFormation:\n\nIn English, the gerund is formed by adding the suffix \"-ing\" to the base form of the verb. For example, \"cooking\", \"eating\", \"playing\".\nIn Spanish, the gerund is formed by removing the verb ending (-ar, -er, or -ir) and adding the appropriate suffix: \"-ando\" for -ar verbs and \"-iendo\" for both -er and -ir verbs. For example, \"cocinar\" (to cook) becomes \"cocinando\", \"comer\" (to eat) becomes \"comiendo\", \"jugar\" (to play) becomes \"jugando\".\nUsage:\n\nIn English, the gerund is used to indicate ongoing actions, continuous or progressive aspects, or as nouns in sentences. For example, \"I am cooking\", \"He enjoys swimming\", \"She likes reading\".\nIn Spanish, the gerund is primarily used to express ongoing actions or actions in progress. It's often used in combination with the verb \"estar\" to form the present progressive tense, indicating an action that is happening at the moment of speaking. For example, \"Estoy cocinando\" (I am cooking), \"Están hablando\" (They are talking). However, unlike English, Spanish does not use the gerund as a noun or in other verbal constructions as extensively. Instead, Spanish often employs infinitive forms or subordinate clauses for these purposes.\nOverall, while the formation of the gerund is similar between English and Spanish, the usage differs. Spanish primarily uses the gerund to indicate ongoing actions in the present tense, while English employs the gerund in a wider range of contexts, including as nouns and to express ongoing actions without the need for an auxiliary verb like \"estar\".",
