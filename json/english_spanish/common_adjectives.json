        "info": "In Spanish, adjectives are words used to describe or modify nouns by providing more information about their characteristics, qualities, or attributes. Here's a breakdown of how adjectives work:\n\nAgreement:\n\nAdjectives must agree in gender (masculine/feminine) and number (singular/plural) with the noun they modify.\nFor example, if the noun is feminine and singular, the adjective must also be feminine and singular. The same rule applies for masculine, plural, and feminine plural nouns.\nPlacement:\n\nIn Spanish, adjectives generally come after the noun they describe. However, some adjectives can come before the noun to emphasize or modify the meaning.\nWhen placed before the noun, adjectives usually have a stronger or more specific meaning (e.g., \"un hombre grande\" - a big man vs. \"un gran hombre\" - a great man).\nForms of Adjectives:\n\nAdjectives have different forms to match the gender and number of the nouns they modify.\nMasculine/Feminine and Singular/Plural:\nFor example, for the adjective \"bonito\" (pretty), it changes to \"bonita\" for feminine singular (\"una chica bonita\" - a pretty girl) and \"bonitos\" for masculine plural (\"chicos bonitos\" - pretty boys).\nIrregular Adjectives:\n\nSome adjectives have irregular forms that don't follow the typical patterns. For instance, \"bueno\" (good) becomes \"buena\" for feminine singular and \"buenos\" for masculine plural.\nComparatives and Superlatives:\n\nAdjectives can also be used in comparative and superlative forms to compare qualities.\nComparative form (comparativo): Expresses a comparison between two things (e.g., \"más grande\" - bigger).\nSuperlative form (superlativo): Indicates the highest degree of a quality (e.g., \"el más grande\" - the biggest).\nDemonstrative and Possessive Adjectives:\n\nSpanish also uses demonstrative adjectives (this, that, these, those) and possessive adjectives (my, your, his, her, its) to specify or show ownership. These, too, follow the gender and number of the nouns they modify.\nUnderstanding adjectives in Spanish involves learning their forms, agreement rules, and different positions within a sentence. Practice and exposure to various examples will help in mastering the use of adjectives to describe nouns effectively in Spanish sentences.",

        "info": "In Spanish, adjectives are words used to describe or modify nouns by providing more information about their characteristics, qualities, or attributes. Here's a breakdown of how adjectives work:\n\nAgreement:\n\nAdjectives must agree in gender (masculine/feminine) and number (singular/plural) with the noun they modify.\nFor example, if the noun is feminine and singular, the adjective must also be feminine and singular. The same rule applies for masculine, plural, and feminine plural nouns.\nPlacement:\n\nIn Spanish, adjectives generally come after the noun they describe. However, some adjectives can come before the noun to emphasize or modify the meaning.\nWhen placed before the noun, adjectives usually have a stronger or more specific meaning (e.g., \"un hombre grande\" - a big man vs. \"un gran hombre\" - a great man).\nForms of Adjectives:\n\nAdjectives have different forms to match the gender and number of the nouns they modify.\nMasculine/Feminine and Singular/Plural:\nFor example, for the adjective \"bonito\" (pretty), it changes to \"bonita\" for feminine singular (\"una chica bonita\" - a pretty girl) and \"bonitos\" for masculine plural (\"chicos bonitos\" - pretty boys).\nIrregular Adjectives:\n\nSome adjectives have irregular forms that don't follow the typical patterns. For instance, \"bueno\" (good) becomes \"buena\" for feminine singular and \"buenos\" for masculine plural.\nComparatives and Superlatives:\n\nAdjectives can also be used in comparative and superlative forms to compare qualities.\nComparative form (comparativo): Expresses a comparison between two things (e.g., \"más grande\" - bigger).\nSuperlative form (superlativo): Indicates the highest degree of a quality (e.g., \"el más grande\" - the biggest).\nDemonstrative and Possessive Adjectives:\n\nSpanish also uses demonstrative adjectives (this, that, these, those) and possessive adjectives (my, your, his, her, its) to specify or show ownership. These, too, follow the gender and number of the nouns they modify.\nUnderstanding adjectives in Spanish involves learning their forms, agreement rules, and different positions within a sentence. Practice and exposure to various examples will help in mastering the use of adjectives to describe nouns effectively in Spanish sentences.",

Here's a breakdown of how adjectives work:\n\nAgreement:\n\nAdjectives must agree in gender (masculine/feminine) and number (singular/plural) with the noun they modify.\nFor example, if the noun is feminine and singular, the adjective must also be feminine and singular. The same rule applies for masculine, plural, and feminine plural nouns.\nPlacement:\n\nIn Spanish, adjectives generally come after the noun they describe. However, some adjectives can come before the noun to emphasize or modify the meaning.\nWhen placed before the noun, adjectives usually have a stronger or more specific meaning (e.g., \"un hombre grande\" - a big man vs. \"un gran hombre\" - a great man).\nForms of Adjectives:\n\nAdjectives have different forms to match the gender and number of the nouns they modify.\nMasculine/Feminine and Singular/Plural:\nFor example, for the adjective \"bonito\" (pretty), it changes to \"bonita\" for feminine singular (\"una chica bonita\" - a pretty girl) and \"bonitos\" for masculine plural (\"chicos bonitos\" - pretty boys).\nIrregular Adjectives:\n\nSome adjectives have irregular forms that don't follow the typical patterns. For instance, \"bueno\" (good) becomes \"buena\" for feminine singular and \"buenos\" for masculine plural.\nComparatives and Superlatives:\n\nAdjectives can also be used in comparative and superlative forms to compare qualities.\nComparative form (comparativo): Expresses a comparison between two things (e.g., \"más grande\" - bigger).\nSuperlative form (superlativo): Indicates the highest degree of a quality (e.g., \"el más grande\" - the biggest).\nDemonstrative and Possessive Adjectives:\n\nSpanish also uses demonstrative adjectives (this, that, these, those) and possessive adjectives (my, your, his, her, its) to specify or show ownership. These, too, follow the gender and number of the nouns they modify.\nUnderstanding adjectives in Spanish involves learning their forms, agreement rules, and different positions within a sentence. Practice and exposure to various examples will help in mastering the use of adjectives to describe nouns effectively in Spanish sentences.",

Here's a breakdown of how adjectives work:\n\nAgreement:\n\nAdjectives must agree in gender (masculine/feminine) and number (singular/plural) with the noun they modify.\nFor example, if the noun is feminine and singular, the adjective must also be feminine and singular. The same rule applies for masculine, plural, and feminine plural nouns.\nPlacement:\n\nIn Spanish, adjectives generally come after the noun they describe. However, some adjectives can come before the noun to emphasize or modify the meaning.\nWhen placed before the noun, adjectives usually have a stronger or more specific meaning (e.g., \"un hombre grande\" - a big man vs. \"un gran hombre\" - a great man).\nForms of Adjectives:\n\nAdjectives have different forms to match the gender and number of the nouns they modify.\nMasculine/Feminine and Singular/Plural:\nFor example, for the adjective \"bonito\" (pretty), it changes to \"bonita\" for feminine singular (\"una chica bonita\" - a pretty girl) and \"bonitos\" for masculine plural (\"chicos bonitos\" - pretty boys).\nIrregular Adjectives:\n\nSome adjectives have irregular forms that don't follow the typical patterns. For instance, \"bueno\" (good) becomes \"buena\" for feminine singular and \"buenos\" for masculine plural.\nComparatives and Superlatives:\n\nAdjectives can also be used in comparative and superlative forms to compare qualities.\nComparative form (comparativo): Expresses a comparison between two things (e.g., \"más grande\" - bigger).\nSuperlative form (superlativo): Indicates the highest degree of a quality (e.g., \"el más grande\" - the biggest).\nDemonstrative and Possessive Adjectives:\n\nSpanish also uses demonstrative adjectives (this, that, these, those) and possessive adjectives (my, your, his, her, its) to specify or show ownership. These, too, follow the gender and number of the nouns they modify.\nUnderstanding adjectives in Spanish involves learning their forms, agreement rules, and different positions within a sentence. Practice and exposure to various examples will help in mastering the use of adjectives to describe nouns effectively in Spanish sentences.",
