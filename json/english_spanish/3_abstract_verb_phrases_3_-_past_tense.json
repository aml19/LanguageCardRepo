It often denotes actions that happened at a specific point in time.\nThe preterite often narrates actions that are viewed as completed events in the past. It's commonly used in storytelling or to describe a sequence of events.\nThe imperfect sets the scene, describes ongoing actions, states of being, or habitual actions in the past. It provides background information or context for events.\nUnderstanding when to use the preterite and imperfect involves considering the nature of the action or event described and the context in which it's used.
