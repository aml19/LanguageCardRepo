        "info": "In German, the infinitive is the base form of a verb. It is the unconjugated form of the verb that you would find in the dictionary. Unlike English, where the infinitive is typically preceded by \"to,\" German infinitive verbs are one-word forms that end in -en or -n. However, there are irregular verbs that may have a different infinitive ending.\n\nFor regular verbs, the infinitive endings are:\n\n-en Verbs:\n\nExamples: lesen (to read), schreiben (to write), trinken (to drink)\nMost German verbs belong to this group.\n-n Verbs:\n\nExample: tun (to do), sein (to be)\nA few German verbs end in -n in the infinitive.\nInfinitive verbs in German serve as the base for conjugation, much like in English and other languages. Conjugation involves changing the verb form to match the subject of a sentence and may also involve changes for tense, mood, and person.",
