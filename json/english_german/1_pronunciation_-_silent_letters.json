        "info": "German and English share many consonant sounds, but their usage and pronunciation can differ significantly. Here are the key differences:\n\n1. Consonant Clusters:\nGerman: Allows more complex consonant clusters, including at the beginning of words (e.g., \"Schwarz\" /ʃvaʁts/ for \"black\").\n\nEnglish: Tends to simplify clusters (e.g., \"black\" instead of \"blck\").\n\n2. Voicing Differences:\nGerman: Final consonants are often devoiced, meaning voiced consonants (like /b/, /d/, /g/) become voiceless (/p/, /t/, /k/) at the end of a word.\n\nExample: \"Tag\" /taːk/ (\"day\"), \"ab\" /ap/ (\"off\").\n\nEnglish: Maintains voicing at the end of words (e.g., \"bag\" stays /bæɡ/).\n\n3. Aspiration of Plosives:\nGerman: Less aspiration of /p/, /t/, /k/ than in English.\n\nExample: \"Pferd\" /pfeːɐ̯t/ (\"horse\") – a clear /p/ with little air.\n\nEnglish: Strongly aspirated /pʰ/, /tʰ/, /kʰ/ at the beginning of stressed syllables.\n\nExample: \"top\" /tʰɒp/.\n\n4. Pronunciation of \"r\":\nGerman: Typically a uvular trill or fricative [ʁ] or a vocalized /ɐ/ sound in some regions.\n\nExample: \"Rot\" /ʁoːt/ (\"red\").\n\nEnglish: Typically a retroflex or bunched /ɹ/ in most dialects.\n\nExample: \"red\" /ɹɛd/.\n\n5. Distinct Sounds in German:\n/ç/ and /x/: Common in German, as in \"ich\" /ɪç/ (\"I\") and \"Buch\" /buːx/ (\"book\").\n\nEnglish: Lacks these sounds, using only /k/ or /g/ in similar positions.\n\n6. Use of /ʃ/:\nGerman: Occurs more frequently and can appear at the start of words (e.g., \"Schule\" /ˈʃuːlə/ - \"school\").\n\nEnglish: Less frequent at the start (e.g., \"shoe\" /ʃuː/).\n\n7. Soft \"s\" and Hard \"z\":\nGerman: Has a clear distinction between /s/ (voiceless, like \"See\" /zeː/ - \"lake\") and /z/ (voiced, like \"Sohn\" /zoːn/ - \"son\").\n\nEnglish: \"s\" can be voiced or voiceless without strict rules (e.g., \"rise\" /raɪz/ vs. \"rice\" /raɪs/).\n\n8. Glottal Stops:\nGerman: Often uses a glottal stop /ʔ/ before vowels at the start of words.\n\nExample: \"Apfel\" /ˈʔapfəl/ (\"apple\").\n\nEnglish: Rare and mostly found in some dialects or for emphasis.\n\n9. Pronunciation of \"w\":\nGerman: Pronounced as /v/ in most cases (e.g., \"Wasser\" /ˈvasɐ/ - \"water\").\n\nEnglish: A clear /w/ sound (e.g., \"water\" /ˈwɔːtər/).\n\n",
