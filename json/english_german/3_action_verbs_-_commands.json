Sometimes there might be umlaut changes or vowel changes. Additionally, the pronoun \"du\" is usually omitted in commands.\n\nFor example:\n\nGeh! (Go!)\nIss! (Eat!)\nKomm!

The verb stays in its base form without any changes.\n\nFor example:\n\nGehen Sie! (Go!)\nEssen Sie! (Eat!)\nKommen Sie! (Come!)\nIhr (plural informal): The command form for \"ihr\" uses the verb stem of the infinitive with \"-t\" ending added to it. The pronoun \"ihr\" is usually omitted in commands.\n\nFor example:\n\nGeht! (Go!)\nEsst! (Eat!)\nKommt!
