        "info": "In German, the grammar used to construct sentences with gerunds involves several key aspects, including verb conjugation, word order, and agreement. Here's a general overview of the grammar used:\n\nVerb Conjugation: German verbs change forms based on the subject, tense, and mood. When forming gerunds, the present participle (-end) is typically used. However, it's important to note that German doesn't have a true gerund in the same sense as English. Instead, it uses various constructions to express similar concepts. For example:\n\n\"Der singende Mann\" (The singing man) - Here, \"singende\" is the present participle of the verb \"singen\" (to sing).\nWord Order: German sentences generally follow a subject-verb-object (SVO) order, though this can vary depending on the sentence structure and emphasis. In sentences with gerunds, the present participle typically comes after the noun it modifies. For example:\n\n\"Das schlafende Mädchen\" (The sleeping girl) - Here, \"schlafende\" modifies the noun \"Mädchen\" (girl).\nAgreement: In German, nouns, adjectives, and articles must agree in gender, number, and case with each other. This means that the endings of adjectives and articles change depending on the gender, number, and case of the noun they modify. When using gerunds, adjectives and articles agree with the noun they modify. For example:\n\n\"Der singende Mann\" (The singing man) - Here, \"der\" is the definite article for masculine singular nominative, agreeing with \"Mann.\"\n\"Die lachende Frau\" (The laughing woman) - Here, \"die\" is the definite article for feminine singular nominative, agreeing with \"Frau.\"\nSentence Structure: While German sentences generally follow an SVO order, subordinate clauses, conjunctions, and other elements can affect the word order. In more complex sentences, the conjugated verb often moves to the end of the clause. For example:\n\n\"Sie hat das Abendessen gekocht, als ich ankam.\" (She was cooking dinner when I arrived.) - Here, the conjugated verb \"hat\" (has) is at the second position in the main clause, while \"gekocht\" (cooked) appears at the end of the subordinate clause.\nUnderstanding these aspects of German grammar is essential for constructing sentences with gerunds accurately and effectively communicating in the language. While German may not have a direct equivalent of the English gerund, similar concepts can be expressed using present participles and other constructions.",
