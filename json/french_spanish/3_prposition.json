        "info": "In Spanish, prepositions are words that typically come before a noun or pronoun and establish a relationship between that noun or pronoun and another element in the sentence. Here's a basic overview of the grammar of prepositions in Spanish:\n\n1. **Position**: Prepositions are placed before the noun or pronoun they modify. For example:\n   - \"en la mesa\" (on the table)\n   - \"con mi amigo\" (with my friend)\n\n2. **Agreement**: In Spanish, prepositions do not change form based on the gender or number of the noun they modify. They remain the same regardless of whether the noun is masculine, feminine, singular, or plural. For example:\n   - \"en el libro\" (in the book) - masculine singular\n   - \"en la mesa\" (on the table) - feminine singular\n   - \"en los libros\" (in the books) - masculine plural\n   - \"en las mesas\" (on the tables) - feminine plural\n\n3. **Usage**: Prepositions in Spanish are used to indicate various relationships, including location, time, manner, cause, and more. Some common prepositions in Spanish include \"en\" (in, on, at), \"de\" (of, from), \"a\" (to, at), \"por\" (for, by), \"con\" (with), and \"para\" (for, to), among others.\n\n4. **Contractions**: In some cases, prepositions in Spanish can contract with certain articles or pronouns. For example:\n   - \"del\" = \"de\" + \"el\" (of the)\n   - \"al\" = \"a\" + \"el\" (to the)\n   - \"conmigo\" = \"con\" + \"mí\" (with me)\n\n5. **Prepositional Phrases**: Prepositions in Spanish often form prepositional phrases when combined with nouns, pronouns, or other elements. These phrases provide additional information about location, time, direction, etc. For example:\n   - \"a la casa\" (to the house)\n   - \"en la mañana\" (in the morning)\n   - \"con mi hermana\" (with my sister)\n\nUnderstanding the basic grammar of prepositions is essential for constructing grammatically correct sentences and expressing ideas accurately in Spanish.",

        "info": "In Spanish, prepositions are words that typically come before a noun or pronoun and establish a relationship between that noun or pronoun and another element in the sentence. Here's a basic overview of the grammar of prepositions in Spanish:\n\n1. **Position**: Prepositions are placed before the noun or pronoun they modify. For example:\n   - \"en la mesa\" (on the table)\n   - \"con mi amigo\" (with my friend)\n\n2. **Agreement**: In Spanish, prepositions do not change form based on the gender or number of the noun they modify. They remain the same regardless of whether the noun is masculine, feminine, singular, or plural. For example:\n   - \"en el libro\" (in the book) - masculine singular\n   - \"en la mesa\" (on the table) - feminine singular\n   - \"en los libros\" (in the books) - masculine plural\n   - \"en las mesas\" (on the tables) - feminine plural\n\n3. **Usage**: Prepositions in Spanish are used to indicate various relationships, including location, time, manner, cause, and more. Some common prepositions in Spanish include \"en\" (in, on, at), \"de\" (of, from), \"a\" (to, at), \"por\" (for, by), \"con\" (with), and \"para\" (for, to), among others.\n\n4. **Contractions**: In some cases, prepositions in Spanish can contract with certain articles or pronouns. For example:\n   - \"del\" = \"de\" + \"el\" (of the)\n   - \"al\" = \"a\" + \"el\" (to the)\n   - \"conmigo\" = \"con\" + \"mí\" (with me)\n\n5. **Prepositional Phrases**: Prepositions in Spanish often form prepositional phrases when combined with nouns, pronouns, or other elements. These phrases provide additional information about location, time, direction, etc. For example:\n   - \"a la casa\" (to the house)\n   - \"en la mañana\" (in the morning)\n   - \"con mi hermana\" (with my sister)\n\nUnderstanding the basic grammar of prepositions is essential for constructing grammatically correct sentences and expressing ideas accurately in Spanish.",

        "info": "In Spanish, prepositions are words that typically come before a noun or pronoun and establish a relationship between that noun or pronoun and another element in the sentence. Here's a basic overview of the grammar of prepositions in Spanish:\n\n1. **Position**: Prepositions are placed before the noun or pronoun they modify. For example:\n   - \"en la mesa\" (on the table)\n   - \"con mi amigo\" (with my friend)\n\n2. **Agreement**: In Spanish, prepositions do not change form based on the gender or number of the noun they modify. They remain the same regardless of whether the noun is masculine, feminine, singular, or plural. For example:\n   - \"en el libro\" (in the book) - masculine singular\n   - \"en la mesa\" (on the table) - feminine singular\n   - \"en los libros\" (in the books) - masculine plural\n   - \"en las mesas\" (on the tables) - feminine plural\n\n3. **Usage**: Prepositions in Spanish are used to indicate various relationships, including location, time, manner, cause, and more. Some common prepositions in Spanish include \"en\" (in, on, at), \"de\" (of, from), \"a\" (to, at), \"por\" (for, by), \"con\" (with), and \"para\" (for, to), among others.\n\n4. **Contractions**: In some cases, prepositions in Spanish can contract with certain articles or pronouns. For example:\n   - \"del\" = \"de\" + \"el\" (of the)\n   - \"al\" = \"a\" + \"el\" (to the)\n   - \"conmigo\" = \"con\" + \"mí\" (with me)\n\n5. **Prepositional Phrases**: Prepositions in Spanish often form prepositional phrases when combined with nouns, pronouns, or other elements. These phrases provide additional information about location, time, direction, etc. For example:\n   - \"a la casa\" (to the house)\n   - \"en la mañana\" (in the morning)\n   - \"con mi hermana\" (with my sister)\n\nUnderstanding the basic grammar of prepositions is essential for constructing grammatically correct sentences and expressing ideas accurately in Spanish.",
