        "info": "The grammar used in the provided Spanish sentences involves several key elements, including verb conjugation, the use of gerunds, and past continuous tense. Let's break it down:\n\nGerunds (Gerundios): In Spanish, gerunds are formed by adding the suffix \"-ando\" to -ar verbs and \"-iendo\" to both -er and -ir verbs. Gerunds are used to indicate ongoing actions or actions in progress. For example:\n\n\"El chico cantando\" (The singing boy): Here, \"cantando\" is the gerund form of the verb \"cantar\" (to sing), indicating that the boy is currently singing.\nPast Continuous Tense (Pretérito imperfecto de indicativo): This tense is used to describe actions that were ongoing or in progress in the past. In Spanish, the past continuous tense is formed by conjugating the verb \"estar\" (to be) in the imperfect tense and adding the gerund (-ando or -iendo) of the main verb. For example:\n\n\"Ella estaba cocinando la cena cuando llegué\" (She was cooking dinner when I arrived): In this sentence, \"estaba cocinando\" is the past continuous tense, indicating that she was in the process of cooking when the speaker arrived.\nVerb Conjugation: Spanish verbs are conjugated to agree with the subject in terms of person and number. This applies to both the auxiliary verb \"estar\" and the main verb. For example:\n\n\"Ellos estaban bailando juntos en la fiesta\" (They were dancing together at the party): In this sentence, \"estaban\" is the conjugated form of the verb \"estar\" for the subject \"ellos\" (they), and \"bailando\" is the gerund form of the verb \"bailar\" (to dance).\nAdjective Placement: Adjectives typically come after the noun they modify in Spanish, unlike English where they usually come before the noun. For example:\n\n\"La chica durmiendo\" (The sleeping girl): Here, \"durmiendo\" (sleeping) is placed after the noun \"chica\" (girl).\nSubordinate Clauses: Spanish often uses subordinate clauses introduced by conjunctions like \"cuando\" (when) to provide additional context or describe events that happen simultaneously. For example:\n\n\"Nosotros estábamos almorzando cuando sonó el teléfono\" (We were eating lunch when the phone rang): In this sentence, \"cuando sonó el teléfono\" (when the phone rang) is a subordinate clause indicating the timing of the action.\nOverall, while Spanish grammar shares some similarities with English, such as the use of verb tenses to indicate time and the basic subject-verb-object sentence structure, there are also notable differences, particularly in verb conjugation, use of gerunds, and word order.",

        "info": "The grammar used in the provided Spanish sentences involves several key elements, including verb conjugation, the use of gerunds, and past continuous tense. Let's break it down:\n\nGerunds (Gerundios): In Spanish, gerunds are formed by adding the suffix \"-ando\" to -ar verbs and \"-iendo\" to both -er and -ir verbs. Gerunds are used to indicate ongoing actions or actions in progress. For example:\n\n\"El chico cantando\" (The singing boy): Here, \"cantando\" is the gerund form of the verb \"cantar\" (to sing), indicating that the boy is currently singing.\nPast Continuous Tense (Pretérito imperfecto de indicativo): This tense is used to describe actions that were ongoing or in progress in the past. In Spanish, the past continuous tense is formed by conjugating the verb \"estar\" (to be) in the imperfect tense and adding the gerund (-ando or -iendo) of the main verb. For example:\n\n\"Ella estaba cocinando la cena cuando llegué\" (She was cooking dinner when I arrived): In this sentence, \"estaba cocinando\" is the past continuous tense, indicating that she was in the process of cooking when the speaker arrived.\nVerb Conjugation: Spanish verbs are conjugated to agree with the subject in terms of person and number. This applies to both the auxiliary verb \"estar\" and the main verb. For example:\n\n\"Ellos estaban bailando juntos en la fiesta\" (They were dancing together at the party): In this sentence, \"estaban\" is the conjugated form of the verb \"estar\" for the subject \"ellos\" (they), and \"bailando\" is the gerund form of the verb \"bailar\" (to dance).\nAdjective Placement: Adjectives typically come after the noun they modify in Spanish, unlike English where they usually come before the noun. For example:\n\n\"La chica durmiendo\" (The sleeping girl): Here, \"durmiendo\" (sleeping) is placed after the noun \"chica\" (girl).\nSubordinate Clauses: Spanish often uses subordinate clauses introduced by conjunctions like \"cuando\" (when) to provide additional context or describe events that happen simultaneously. For example:\n\n\"Nosotros estábamos almorzando cuando sonó el teléfono\" (We were eating lunch when the phone rang): In this sentence, \"cuando sonó el teléfono\" (when the phone rang) is a subordinate clause indicating the timing of the action.\nOverall, while Spanish grammar shares some similarities with English, such as the use of verb tenses to indicate time and the basic subject-verb-object sentence structure, there are also notable differences, particularly in verb conjugation, use of gerunds, and word order.",

For example:\n\n\"El chico cantando\" (The singing boy): Here, \"cantando\" is the gerund form of the verb \"cantar\" (to sing), indicating that the boy is currently singing.\nPast Continuous Tense (Pretérito imperfecto de indicativo): This tense is used to describe actions that were ongoing or in progress in the past. In Spanish, the past continuous tense is formed by conjugating the verb \"estar\" (to be) in the imperfect tense and adding the gerund (-ando or -iendo) of the main verb. For example:\n\n\"Ella estaba cocinando la cena cuando llegué\" (She was cooking dinner when I arrived): In this sentence, \"estaba cocinando\" is the past continuous tense, indicating that she was in the process of cooking when the speaker arrived.\nVerb Conjugation: Spanish verbs are conjugated to agree with the subject in terms of person and number. This applies to both the auxiliary verb \"estar\" and the main verb. For example:\n\n\"Ellos estaban bailando juntos en la fiesta\" (They were dancing together at the party): In this sentence, \"estaban\" is the conjugated form of the verb \"estar\" for the subject \"ellos\" (they), and \"bailando\" is the gerund form of the verb \"bailar\" (to dance).\nAdjective Placement: Adjectives typically come after the noun they modify in Spanish, unlike English where they usually come before the noun. For example:\n\n\"La chica durmiendo\" (The sleeping girl): Here, \"durmiendo\" (sleeping) is placed after the noun \"chica\" (girl).\nSubordinate Clauses: Spanish often uses subordinate clauses introduced by conjunctions like \"cuando\" (when) to provide additional context or describe events that happen simultaneously. For example:\n\n\"Nosotros estábamos almorzando cuando sonó el teléfono\" (We were eating lunch when the phone rang): In this sentence, \"cuando sonó el teléfono\" (when the phone rang) is a subordinate clause indicating the timing of the action.\nOverall, while Spanish grammar shares some similarities with English, such as the use of verb tenses to indicate time and the basic subject-verb-object sentence structure, there are also notable differences, particularly in verb conjugation, use of gerunds, and word order.",
