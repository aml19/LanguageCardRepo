        "info": "In Spanish, an indirect object indicates to whom or for whom an action is performed. It usually answers the questions \"to whom?\" or \"for whom?\" regarding the action of the verb. Indirect objects can be nouns, pronouns, or prepositional phrases.\n\nHere's a basic overview of how indirect objects are used grammatically in Spanish:\n\n1. **Nouns as Indirect Objects:** In sentences with a direct object, the indirect object typically comes before the direct object. For example:\n   - Le di el libro. (I gave him the book.)\n   - Me compró un regalo. (He bought me a gift.)\n\n2. **Pronouns as Indirect Objects:** Indirect object pronouns are used to replace indirect object nouns to avoid repetition and make sentences more concise. The placement of the pronoun is usually before the conjugated verb or attached to an infinitive or gerund.\n   - Le di el libro. → Le di el libro. (I gave him the book.)\n   - Me compró un regalo. → Me lo compró. (He bought me a gift.)\n\n3. **Prepositional Phrases as Indirect Objects:** Sometimes, indirect objects are expressed through prepositional phrases with the prepositions \"a\" or \"para.\" These prepositional phrases usually indicate the recipient or beneficiary of the action.\n   - Él escribió una carta a su madre.

        "info": "In Spanish, an indirect object indicates to whom or for whom an action is performed. It usually answers the questions \"to whom?\" or \"for whom?\" regarding the action of the verb. Indirect objects can be nouns, pronouns, or prepositional phrases.\n\nHere's a basic overview of how indirect objects are used grammatically in Spanish:\n\n1. **Nouns as Indirect Objects:** In sentences with a direct object, the indirect object typically comes before the direct object. For example:\n   - Le di el libro. (I gave him the book.)\n   - Me compró un regalo. (He bought me a gift.)\n\n2. **Pronouns as Indirect Objects:** Indirect object pronouns are used to replace indirect object nouns to avoid repetition and make sentences more concise. The placement of the pronoun is usually before the conjugated verb or attached to an infinitive or gerund.\n   - Le di el libro. → Le di el libro. (I gave him the book.)\n   - Me compró un regalo. → Me lo compró. (He bought me a gift.)\n\n3. **Prepositional Phrases as Indirect Objects:** Sometimes, indirect objects are expressed through prepositional phrases with the prepositions \"a\" or \"para.\" These prepositional phrases usually indicate the recipient or beneficiary of the action.\n   - Él escribió una carta a su madre. (He wrote a letter to his mother.)\n   - Compré un regalo para ti. (I bought a gift for you.)\n\nIn summary, indirect objects in Spanish indicate the recipient or beneficiary of an action and can be expressed through nouns, pronouns, or prepositional phrases.

        "info": "In Spanish, an indirect object indicates to whom or for whom an action is performed. It usually answers the questions \"to whom?\" or \"for whom?\" regarding the action of the verb. Indirect objects can be nouns, pronouns, or prepositional phrases.\n\nHere's a basic overview of how indirect objects are used grammatically in Spanish:\n\n1. **Nouns as Indirect Objects:** In sentences with a direct object, the indirect object typically comes before the direct object. For example:\n   - Le di el libro. (I gave him the book.)\n   - Me compró un regalo. (He bought me a gift.)\n\n2. **Pronouns as Indirect Objects:** Indirect object pronouns are used to replace indirect object nouns to avoid repetition and make sentences more concise. The placement of the pronoun is usually before the conjugated verb or attached to an infinitive or gerund.\n   - Le di el libro. → Le di el libro. (I gave him the book.)\n   - Me compró un regalo. → Me lo compró. (He bought me a gift.)\n\n3. **Prepositional Phrases as Indirect Objects:** Sometimes, indirect objects are expressed through prepositional phrases with the prepositions \"a\" or \"para.\" These prepositional phrases usually indicate the recipient or beneficiary of the action.\n   - Él escribió una carta a su madre. (He wrote a letter to his mother.)\n   - Compré un regalo para ti. (I bought a gift for you.)\n\nIn summary, indirect objects in Spanish indicate the recipient or beneficiary of an action and can be expressed through nouns, pronouns, or prepositional phrases.
