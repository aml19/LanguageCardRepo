        "info": "In Spanish, the infinitive is the base form of a verb. It is the unconjugated form that you would find in the dictionary. Infinitive verbs in Spanish end in -ar, -er, or -ir, which helps classify them into three main verb groups.\n\n-ar Verbs:\n\nExamples: hablar (to speak), estudiar (to study), bailar (to dance)\nThe majority of Spanish verbs belong to this group.\n-er Verbs:\n\nExamples: comer (to eat), beber (to drink), aprender (to learn)\nThis group includes verbs that end in -er.\n-ir Verbs:\n\nExamples: vivir (to live), escribir (to write), abrir (to open)\nThis group includes verbs that end in -ir.\nInfinitive verbs in Spanish serve as a base for conjugation. Conjugation is the process of changing the verb form to match the subject of a sentence, as well as the tense, mood, and aspect. Unlike English, where the infinitive form is often preceded by \"to,\" in Spanish, the infinitive itself is used and may be the form found in a dictionary.",
